To calculate the average typing speed from a typing test, you typically measure it in words per minute (WPM) or characters per minute (CPM). Here's a step-by-step process for each method:

### Words Per Minute (WPM)

1. **Record Total Time**: Note the total time taken for the typing test in minutes. If you have the time in seconds, divide it by 60 to convert it to minutes.

2. **Count Words Typed**: Count the total number of words typed during the test. A standard word in typing tests is usually considered to be 5 characters long, including spaces and punctuation.

3. **Calculate WPM**:
   \[
   \text{WPM} = \frac{\text{Number of Words Typed}}{\text{Time in Minutes}}
   \]

   Example: If you typed 300 words in 5 minutes, the average speed would be:
   \[
   \text{WPM} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
   \]

### Characters Per Minute (CPM)

1. **Record Total Time**: Note the total time taken for the typing test in minutes.

2. **Count Characters Typed**: Count the total number of characters typed, including spaces and punctuation.

3. **Calculate CPM**:
   \[
   \text{CPM} = \frac{\text{Number of Characters Typed}}{\text{Time in Minutes}}
   \]

   Example: If you typed 1500 characters in 5 minutes, the average speed would be:
   \[
   \text{CPM} = \frac{1500}{5} = 300
   \]

### Detailed Steps

1. **Start the Test**: Begin with a specific text or use an online typing test tool.

2. **Typing Session**: Type the text as accurately as possible. Most tests will automatically measure the time taken.

3. **Completion**: Note the total time taken and the number of words or characters typed.

4. **Calculate**: Use the formulas above to determine your average typing speed.

### Example Calculation

Suppose you took a typing test that lasted for 3 minutes and you typed 210 words. To find your average WPM:

1. **Total Time**: 3 minutes
2. **Number of Words Typed**: 210 words
3. **WPM Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{WPM} = \frac{210}{3} = 70
   \]

To calculate your average typing speed in words per minute (WPM), you need to follow these steps:

### Steps to Calculate WPM

1. **Determine the Total Time in Minutes**:
   - You took 84 seconds.
   - Convert this to minutes by dividing by 60.
     \[
     \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{84}{60} = 1.4 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Count the Number of Words Typed**:
   - You typed 25 words.

3. **Calculate the Words Per Minute**:
   \[
   \text{WPM} = \frac{\text{Number of Words Typed}}{\text{Time in Minutes}}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{WPM} = \frac{25}{1.4} \approx 17.86 \text{ words per minute}
   \]

When rounded to the nearest whole number, this is approximately 18 WPM.

### Why 18 WPM?

- The typing speed is calculated by dividing the number of words typed by the time taken in minutes.
- Here, you typed 25 words in 1.4 minutes, leading to an average speed of about 17.86 words per minute, which rounds up to 18 WPM.

### Detailed Calculation

1. **Convert Seconds to Minutes**:
   \[
   \frac{84}{60} = 1.4 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate WPM**:
   \[
   \frac{25}{1.4} = 17.8571 \approx 18 \text{ WPM}
   \]

So, your average typing speed is 18 words per minute when you round to the nearest whole number.

### Calculation Breakdown

- **Time Conversion**: 84 seconds is 1.4 minutes.
- **Division**: 25 words divided by 1.4 minutes results in approximately 17.86 WPM.
- **Rounding**: Rounding this value to the nearest whole number gives 18 WPM.
